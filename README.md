Chess.com Historical Games Data Analyses 

This app pulls games from Chess.com's API and 1) summarizes time controls played each year, 2) identifies the five best and worst openings for each color for a given year and time control combination, 3) reports some useful tidbits about opponents, 4) plots the average annual rating for the year and time control combination, and 5) displays the top 10 most frequent openings played for a given year and time control combination.  

All of the .py files are scaffolding except test_funcs_dropdown.py which is the production code (despite 'test' being in the filename!).  

Originally I thought this would be hosted on Streamlit but ultimately deployed it to Heroku.

Example usernames that will work are: Mau5, RaeKwan, and UlfHeavypaws.
